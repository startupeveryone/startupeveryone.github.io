have earned during their entire operating history, just to to see if they can
produce something of value.</p><p>Digital payment technology has reached a point where it&rsquo;s possible to send
money to many people for a reasonably low cost.</p><p>The timing is right for a number of reasons to provide every person the
resources necessary to ensure their basic needs are met.</p><p>In essence: <strong>we want to startup everyone</strong>.</p></dd></div><div><dt>Who is it for?</dt><dd><p>Everyone. Everyone who needs it. Everyone who wants it.</p><p>Everyone should have their basic needs met.</p></dd></div><div><dt>How will you do this?</dt><dd><p>We will collect money contributed by those who choose to give it, and
distribute money to people who need it.</p><p>We will publish anonymized data that documents all funds that are received
and distributed, so that everyone can verify that we are fulfilling our
mission and that the money is going where we say it is.</p><p>I could really use some additional money to help make ends meet. What do I
need to do to participate? We&rsquo;re still figuring out the logistics of
signing people up and getting funds to everyone.</p><p>When we&rsquo;re ready, we&rsquo;ll post an update and give instructions on how to sign
up.</p><p>This all sounds amazing. I&rsquo;d really like to help. How can I help? We&rsquo;re
still figuring out what help we need and how to organize volunteer efforts.</p><p>If you&rsquo;d like to join us in our mission, email us at
<code>volunteering@startupeveryone.com</code> and tell us about yourself and how you
can volunteer to help.</p><p>We also have a <a href=https://discord.gg/8f6b6ydPPq target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Discord server that you can
join</a>.</p></dd></div><div><dt>Has anything like this been done before?

public-private partnership, has raised $1.5 million for an initiative
that gives out $500 a month to 120 households headed by a lone caretaker,
such as a single mother. Last November the city of Chelsea launched a
similar program for about 2,000 low-income families in what is considered
the country’s biggest experiment of the guaranteed income idea. [April

young adults who age out of the foster care system, providing much-needed
support for vulnerable youth transitioning into adulthood. Other cities and
counties should follow Santa Clara County&rsquo;s lead. [February 11, 2021]</p></li></ul></dd></div></dl></main></div></div></body></html>
